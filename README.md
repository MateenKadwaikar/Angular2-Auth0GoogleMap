I tried my hand with Angular 2 , Auth0 and Google Maps. It's just a simple app , which login through Auth0 and then it displays Google Map with the current location.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
